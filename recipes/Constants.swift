        "Nutrition facts are based on a 2 egg omelette without filling.",
        "Using the proper skillet or pan is important to successful omelette making. The ideal skillet for a 1, 2 or 3-egg omelette is about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter at the base. It should be shallow with sloping sides to make it easier to slide the omelette out of the skillet and onto a plate.",
        "An omelette can be made quickly and easier if the skillet is hot when the egg mixture is added. The skillet is hot enough when a drop of water rolls around instead of bursting into steam immediately.",
        "Preparing individual omelettes, rather than one large one, will result in lighter and fluffier omelettes that are easier to handle.",
        "The Perfect Omelette recipe can be multiplied for as many servings as you need. Use 1/2 cup (125 mL) of egg mixture for each 2-egg omelette and 3/4 cup (175 mL) for a 3-egg omelette.",
        "The fewer eggs, the quicker it will cook, so you can use a smaller skillet for a one- or two-egg omelette and one that measures 8-inches (20 cm) at the base for a 3-egg omelette.",
        "You can use cooking spray in place of the butter or oil.",
        "Covering the folded omelette and cooking for an extra minute helps to heat up the filling, melt any cheese, and finish cooking any remaining undercooked egg. This step is optional if your filling doesnâ€™t require heating and the egg already appears cooked to your liking."
